## Sneak Game

### TODO

#### Player control

* try out on actual phone
* Use arrows (and text of destination square) for move buttons
* Two players
* Add facts
* Simulate information flow

#### Dialog Prototype

* Write-up some conversation examples
* Interface for picking in branching conversation
* Network-synced conversation prototype
* Lock-in timer

#### Other

* Identify squares with multiple characters that need dialog

#### Questions?

* Maybe player inputs destinations instead of step-by-step moves? Or we have a pathing assistant?
* Rael-suggested move stack?
