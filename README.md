## Sneak Game

### TODO

* Design tile pieces
* Finish box design
* Highlight the plans when you've just gotten them

### Mechanics Ideas

* A **bug** which gives you information from all conversations had by the character you attach it to. Maybe other players can detect when someone they're talking to is bugged.
* A **trap** which is placed on a square and either 1) detonates and kills the next person who enters that square (all if multiple enter simultaneously) or 2) traps characters in place for N turns when they enter that square.
* A **scan** which lets players either 1) get information from a distant character 2) check if there is a trap on a square 3) check if a character is a player
* A **knife** which lets a player kill a character on any adjacent square
* An **alarm** which causes all NPCs to run to a particular location when triggered
