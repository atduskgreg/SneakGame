## Sneak Game

### TODO

#### Player control

* Show list of moves for all characters for the next round.
* Show player who and where they are
* Prompt for new move choice at end of round

#### Other

* Identify squares with multiple characters that need dialog
* Dialog hello world

#### Questions?

* Maybe player inputs destinations instead of step-by-step moves? Or we have a pathing assistant?
* Rael-suggested move stack?
*
