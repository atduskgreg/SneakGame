## Sneak Game

### TODO

#### Player control

* Synchronize generated characters between clients
* Waiting screen
* Alternate move instructions between players 
* Use arrows (and text of destination square) for move buttons
* Add facts
* Simulate information flow

#### Dialog Prototype

* Add features to script format to control who speaks.
* Randomly decide if each player is an NPC or not.
* Lock-in timer

#### Other

* Identify squares with multiple characters that need dialog

#### Questions?

* Maybe player inputs destinations instead of step-by-step moves? Or we have a pathing assistant?
* Rael-suggested move stack?
