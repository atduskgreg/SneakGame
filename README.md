## Sneak Game

### TODO

#### Player control

* Show count of moves in the turn "x/10"
* Use arrows (and text of destination square) for move buttons
 
#### Other

* Identify squares with multiple characters that need dialog
* Dialog hello world

#### Questions?

* Maybe player inputs destinations instead of step-by-step moves? Or we have a pathing assistant?
* Rael-suggested move stack?
