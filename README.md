## Sneak Game

### TODO

#### Player control

* Shuffle order of character moves
* Show count of moves in the turn "x/10"
* Make the controls and move instructions full-screen and modal

#### Other

* Identify squares with multiple characters that need dialog
* Dialog hello world

#### Questions?

* Maybe player inputs destinations instead of step-by-step moves? Or we have a pathing assistant?
* Rael-suggested move stack?
